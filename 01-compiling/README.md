# Compilation examples

Compile a code is the first thing you have to do before running any of our examples in C/C++.

This module shows you how to compile some basic examples using 4 different strategies:

1. [Plain console](./01-plain-console)
2. [Using Makefile](./02-make)
3. [Using QMake](./03-qmake)
4. [Using CMake](./04-cmake)
