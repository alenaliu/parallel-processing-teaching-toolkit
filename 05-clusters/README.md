# Computer clusters

A [cluster](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_cluster) is a set of connected computers that work together.
Parallel applications can be developed to run on a cluster to improve performance. Two technologies commonly used for this purpose is [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) and [Apache Spark](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark).
Here are some examples:

1. [MPI](./01-mpi)
2. [Apache Spark](./02-spark-apache)
