## About this example

This is the "Hello World" example using OpenMP.

## Requirements

You should have a compiler installed. Ubuntu Linux:

```bash
sudo apt-get install qt-sdk
```

## Run

Open a terminal and type:

```bash
> sh run.sh
```

It will compile the code using the qt compiler. Alternatively, you could use the gcc compiler running:

```bash
> sh gcc-classic-compile.sh
```

## Output

A typical output should look like this one:

```
Hello! my id is 0
Total number of threads = 4
Hello! my id is 2
Hello! my id is 3
Hello! my id is 1
One thread here
```
