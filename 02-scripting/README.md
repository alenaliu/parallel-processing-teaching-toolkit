# Scripting

In next modules, you'll find a `run.sh` file which will compile a run examples for you. That is a bash script, a way of doing multiple tasks only executing a file.

Here are some basic examples that show what you can do with scripting:

1. [Simple script](./01-simple-script)
2. [Using iteration](./02-iteration)
3. [Using command Screen](./03-screen)
